# correctness
this is a fine tuning lln with LoRA.
You can use this model to check the correct spelling of the typed word.
We used a small data set for training and testing, which was collected by ourselves in a short period of time, and the number of epochs is also small, so the accuracy of the tuned model is low. 
If accuracy is important to you, be sure to use a larger dataset and a larger number of epochs.
